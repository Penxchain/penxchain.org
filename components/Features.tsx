          <h3>Privacy First</h3>
          <p>
            In today&apos;s digital world, personal data is often treated as a
            commodity—tracked, collected, and sold without full awareness or
            consent. From browsing habits to purchase history, this information
            is monetized, leading to intrusive ads, unwanted solicitations, and
            the unsettling feeling of being constantly watched.

            digital assets and data, placing the power back in your hands. Your
